<h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro">about</a></h2>

   <p>The word <i>escarcelle</i> is the name of the purse that used to be worn at the belt.</p>
   <p>Escarcelle is an invitation to barter a personal object with high sentimental value, in exchange for a similar object but belonging to a stranger.</p>

<h2 id="how"><a href="#how">how it works?</a></h2>

<p>For now, the market is focused on exchanging postcards. To take park in the bartering process:</p>

<ul>
<li>take a look at <a class="importantlink" href="./market_now.html">actual state of the market</a> on the Escarcelle website.</li>
<li>there is something you like? you will need to find a postcard to offer in exchange. select a postcard of sentimental value that belongs to you.</li>
<li>fill the <a class="importantlink" href="https://framaforms.org/submit-an-object-escarcelle-1636460933">form to submit a postcard</a>. not all memories are equal. to help preserve the quality of postcards found on the market, we need to make sure that all of them are relevant to the project.</li>
<li>don't forget to tell us which object is of interest to you - we will put it aside.</li>
<li>if your object was chosen, you will receive an email with the information for the exchange to happen.</li>
<li>send your postcard by mail.</li>
<li>as soon as we will receive your postcard, we will send you the one you selected by mail.</li>
</ul>
