<h3 id="past"><a href="#past">the sea</a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/sea_id01a.png" alt="drawing of a sailor with the following text: 'hold everything! until you hear from me. I am not sick of the nay - only the sea!"/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked souvenir</span>: Memories of a man who would visit his wife during the war, leave her with a new kid on the way and return to his ship in the Pacific. So many questions I would have asked them if I'd understood things in time..</p>

<p><span class="idsouvenir">Identification number</span>: 01a</p>


<h3 id="future"><a href="#future">a short winter</a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/hiver_id00b.png" alt="picture of a MontrÃ©al street after a big snowfall."/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked souvenir</span>: A winter so short no one changes their tires anymore. The last shoveling business went bankrupt. Yesterday, I was trying to remember the sound made when walking on fresh snow after a storm.</p>

<p><span class="idsouvenir">Identification number</span>: 00b</p>

<h3 id="madeup"><a href="#madeup">saguaro 1</a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/saguaro_id01c.jpg" alt="a colourful drawing of the Rincon Peak, Saguaro National Park. Cacti are displayed and there is a mountain in the background."/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked souvenir</span>: I went to the desert to be away from the snow and to do some climbing. It rained, the climbing plans fell through... And then the blooming cacti miracle happened. --- Yannick (original in French, translation by the market)</p>

<p><span class="idsouvenir">Identification number</span>: 01c</p>


<h3 id="ontopic"><a href="#ontopic">climbing</a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/escalade_id00d.jpg" alt="A comic about two climbers, one is upside-down in a dangerous setting. They say to the other: 'Oh, Bob. I've changed my mind. I don't care that my life isn't as exciting as a beer commercial after all."/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked souvenir</span>: My first fall in traditional climbing: I was pretty sure I was about to die during the quarter of a second that it lasted. Fortunately, the camalot worked. What an adventure! --- Yannick (original in French, translation by the market)</p>

<p><span class="idsouvenir">Identification number</span>: 00d</p>


<h3 id="control"><a href="#control">saguaro 2</a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/saguaro_id00e.jpg" alt="a colourful drawing of a group of cacti in the Saguaro National Park."/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked souvenir</span>: I was in the desert, looking carefully at how nothing was moving. I did not notice that time was flying by. When I finally woke up from my meditation, I had quite the sunburn! --- Yannick (original in French, translation by the market)</p>
