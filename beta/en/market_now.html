<h3 id="bottle"><a href="#bottle">Klein bottle</a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/klein_id0b.png" alt="picture of a Klein bottle made of glass"/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked souvenir</span>: I was a mathematics student, and topology was one of my favorite topics. A Klein bottle is not orientable, meaning we cannot say that one side of its surface is outside while the other is inside in a coherent way. I bought this bottle out of curiosity, and it has proven to be a great converstaion started. I would be happy to see it make its own path in another home.</p>

<p><img src="../images/carte_id0c.png" alt="picture of a playing card on which it is written: cafetière - un café par tour (coffeemaker - one coffee by turn)"/></p>

<p><span class="descsouvenir">Linked memory</span>: A few years ago, I was working on a board game whose theme was the feelings associated with doing mathematics research. This is one of the cards of one of the first prototypes of this game.</p>
