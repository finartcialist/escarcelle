<h3>a short artist's statement</h3>
<p>If you were closer to me - if I was a bit more like you - would it be easier to understand each other?</p>

<p>How do we become who we say we are? What is the role played by souvenirs - memories - in the making of a self? Would you still be the same person if you had other memories? Could you have someone else's memories? How could you have them?</p>

<p>In <i>escarcelle, le march√© aux sentiments</i> (escarcelle, the feelings market), I am exploring the idea of a market that allows you to experience what it means to be someone else, someone you are not.</p>

<p>In this market, you are invited to trade your souvenirs with strangers, obtaining novel ones for you to experience.</p>

<p>This work explores the notion of souvenir as a tradable object. Can you feel what I feel? Can I affect you in the way I was affected? Can we buy someone else's precise experience?</p>

<p>Feel welcome to ask me questions by email at <a href="mailto:escarcelle@finartcialist.com">escarcelle@finartcialist.com</a> - I will be happy to discuss the project with you.</p>
