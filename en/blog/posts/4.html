<h3>creating a postcard</h3>
<p>"I would love to participate, but I don't have any postcard available for exchange! What can I do?"</p>

<p>For the beta version, the focus is less about the object itself than about the memories.</p>
<p>This is why there are many ways to participate by creating a postcard.</p>

<p>You may buy a new postcard, writing your souvenir - real or not, or wished for - on it.</p>
<p>You may buy or re-use a rectangular cardboard piece in order to decorate it. Don't forget to add your souvenir!</p>
<p>You may use a picture in order to create a postcard.</p>
<p>I hope that this inspires you!</p>

<p>I will answer your questions by email at <a href="mailto:escarcelle@finartcialist.com">escarcelle@finartcialist.com</a> - I will be happy to discuss the project with you.</p>
