<h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro">about</a></h2>

   <p>The word <i>escarcelle</i> is the name of the purse that used to be worn at the belt.</p>
   <p>Escarcelle is an invitation to barter a personal object with high sentimental value, in exchange for a similar object but belonging to a stranger.</p>
   
<h2 id="how"><a href="#how">how it works?</a></h2>

<p>Here are the steps to barter an object on the curated market:</p>

<ul>
<li>gain an idea of the current state of the market on the Escarcelle website (upcoming).</li>
<li>if there is an object you like, you will need to find one to offer in exchange. select an object with high sentimental value that belongs to you.</li>
<li>now is the time to gain some bartering credit by filling up the submission form. all souvenirs are not made equal. in order to keep a certain quality assurance of objects on the market, we need to make sure that every one of them is relevant.</li>
<li>if your object was selected, you will receive an email giving you all the needed information to access the market.</li>
<li>access the market and select the object you wish you receive in exchange for yours. we will put it aside.</li>
<li>send your object by mail.</li>
<li>after receiving your object, we will send you the one you selected by mail.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beta"><a href="#beta">beta version</a></h2>

<p>In order to make sure that Escarcelle is ready for a future public presentation, we would like to test the exchange protocol and to make sure that every software component of the project works as we want.</p>

<p>With this in mind, there will be a first run of the beta version of the project during Fall 2021.<p>

<p>If you wish to participate, please <a href="https://framaforms.org/escarcelle-the-feelings-market-beta-version-1630770742">fill this form to be chosen for the beta version</a>. We will pick a few participants amongst the answers received in order to start the first cohort.</p>
